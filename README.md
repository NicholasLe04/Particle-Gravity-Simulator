# Particle-Gravity-Simulator
This program allows users to place particles with custom attributes (position, velocity, radius, mass, color) in the scene and simulate the gravitational interactions between them.
Users can also specify the gravitational constant and dampening coefficients!

**DISCLAIMER**: *Can run quite low depending on hardware and amount of particles on screen*
